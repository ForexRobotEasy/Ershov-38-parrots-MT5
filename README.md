## Code Description

This code is designed to be used with the Ershov 38 Parrots MT5 trading strategy. It includes various functions and mechanisms to identify price movement impulses, ignore minor price jumps, adapt to market changes, provide timely warnings, and handle dynamic overbought and oversold levels efficiently.

The main function, `OnInit()`, calls all the necessary functions to execute the strategy. The `OnTick()` function is the entry point of the program, where trading actions can be implemented. The `OnError()` function handles unexpected situations, and the `testProgram()` function is used for thorough testing of the program's functionality and accuracy.
